Info about success of replay complete proofs:
(Note: !!! means that the replay was successfull,
but used significantly fewer proof steps. This 
may be ok, but may also be the result of some 
undesired effect. Therefore the new proof is 
discarded so that you still have the old proof.

*** Successful replayed: ***
