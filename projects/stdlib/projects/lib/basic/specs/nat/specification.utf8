(: must be identical to nat-minus in system/basicrules! :)

enrich nat-basic with

predicates 

	. ≤ . : nat × nat;
	. > . : nat × nat;
	. ≥ . : nat × nat;


partial functions

	. - . : nat × nat → nat prio 8 left with λ n, m. n ≥ m;

axioms

	sub-base: m - 0 = m;
	sub-rec: m - n +1 = (m - n) -1;

	le-def: m ≤ n ↔ ¬ n < m;
	gr-def: m > n ↔   n < m;
	ge-def: m ≥ n ↔ ¬ m < n;

end enrich
